## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A lot of what I learned here was about what NOT to do, and the benefits of certain methodologies like BEM and the use of frameworks. That being said:
- I hadn't used plain number inputs before
- Learning about different devices and their respective breakpoints was worthwhile.]
- I hadn't used revert before.
- The currency formatting I used in this project is likely to come in handy. 
- Also, this was a good exercise in using data attributes.

### Continued development

A lot of things I could improve here:
- I need to learn how to organize my JavaScript
- I ran into some issues with css specificity. It may be worth learning BEM.
- I thought it wouldn't be worth the overhead to set up a framework for this small project, but it may bwe worth it for the organization.
